                My name is Sean Hurley. I have many years of experience in the technical industry, 
                and specifically within software engineering. I see the wonderful company you have and the many 
                beneficial programs your company has created. It must be a lot of work running a company, so 
                maybe if you are tired, you could hand it off to me! 
            </main></p>
            <p><div>
                I am willing to pay as much as you want, no negotiation necessary. 
                Please consider this offer, you will be putting the company in good hands. 
                Thank you for your time.
